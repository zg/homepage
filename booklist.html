				<p>This is a tenative list of books I own.  I have left out many which
					seem unnecessary to list because I am not truly interested in reading
					them.  Most of the unlisted books are Soviet Union related material
					that I had a fascination for back when I was in junior college, but
					never got around to reading them.  Others include books that were
					supplimental material for courses I took, such as a couple books on
					public speaking.</p>
				<p>I hope to one day read every book listed on this page.  The
					following is my progress thus far.</p>
