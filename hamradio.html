        <p>I have recently started to venture into learning more about amateur
          radio (also known as ham radio).  I have always been fascinated by
          radio technology, but haven't had the time to learn how it works.
          Now that I have graduated from university, I have more time on my
          hands and in late September 2016, I started learning about amateur
          radio.</p>
        <p>My girlfriend, Denisse, is a Computer Engineering student at RIT and
          I figured that it would be a good motivation for both of us to try
          and learn enough about radio technology so that the two of us could
          communicate with one another while she is still attending university
          in New York.  So, as of writing this, my goal is to accomplish
          transcontinental radio communication.</p>
        <p>My plans as of now are to obtain my Technician and General license
          through <a href="http://www.arrl.org/">ARRL</a> and then proceed to
          build my own pieces of radio equipment before purchasing professional
          equipment.  I have read numerous times in the 
          <a href="http://www.arrl.org/shop/ARRL-Ham-Radio-License-Manual-3rd-Edition/">ARRL Ham Radio License Manual</a>
          that taking this approach is a valuable experience and it will help
          you understand the internals of the radio technology you use.  This
          helps one to debug certain issues that may arise when working with
          the equipment that they use.</p>
